```{r}
library(sf)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
library(terra)
library(ggplot2)

```

Read in data

```{r}
here()
spain <- sf::st_read(here("data", "gadm41_ESP.gpkg"),
                      layer='ADM_ADM_0')

world_cities <- sf::st_read(here("data", "World_Cities", "World_cities.shp"))

ssp1 <-terra::rast(here("data", "wc2.1_2.5m_tmax_ACCESS-CM2_ssp126_2021-2040.tif"))

ssp1_mean <- mean(ssp1)

ssp5 <-terra::rast(here("data", "wc2.1_2.5m_tmax_ACCESS-CM2_ssp585_2021-2040.tif"))

```

filter cities

```{r}

spanish_cities <- world_cities %>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  dplyr::filter(cntry_name=="Spain")


#ssp_diff <- ssp5-ssp1
```


crop and mask rasters

```{r}
####ssp1

spain_diff <- ssp1 %>%
  # now crop our temp data to the extent
  terra::crop(.,spain)

exact_spain <- spain_diff %>%
  terra::mask(.,spain)

###ssp5

spain_diff5 <- ssp5 %>%
  # now crop our temp data to the extent
  terra::crop(.,spain)

exact_spain5 <- spain_diff5 %>%
  terra::mask(.,spain)

```

subtract rasters

```{r}

#### sub
diff_climate_model <- exact_spain5 - exact_spain 
```

rename and extract data from points

```{r}
month <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
           "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")

names(diff_climate_model) <- month

spain_city_diff<- terra::extract(diff_climate_model, spanish_cities)

```


Join the extracted data back to the point dataset...either this...

```{r}
spain_city_diff2 <- spanish_cities %>% 
  add_column(spain_city_diffJan=spain_city_diff[,2])%>%
  add_column(spain_city_diffFeb=spain_city_diff[,3])%>%
  add_column(spain_city_diffMar=spain_city_diff[,4])%>%
  add_column(spain_city_diffApril=spain_city_diff[,5])%>%
  add_column(spain_city_diffMay=spain_city_diff[,6])%>%
  add_column(spain_city_diffJune=spain_city_diff[,7])%>%
  add_column(spain_city_diffJuly=spain_city_diff[,8])%>%
  add_column(spain_city_diffAug=spain_city_diff[,9])%>%
  add_column(spain_city_diffSept=spain_city_diff[,10])%>%
  add_column(spain_city_diffOct=spain_city_diff[,11])%>%
  add_column(spain_city_diffNov=spain_city_diff[,12])%>%
  add_column(spain_city_diffDec=spain_city_diff[,13])

```

Or make a join ID column in the original point sf and use that to join...

```{r}

spanish_cities_join_ID <- spanish_cities %>%
  dplyr::mutate(join_id= 1:n())
```

Now join

```{r}

spain_city_diff2 <- spanish_cities_join_ID%>%
  dplyr::left_join(.,
            spain_city_diff,
             by = c("join_id" = "ID"))

```

Drop the geometry and make a facet plot of differences per month

```{r}
# all cities in spain where there is data

city_climate_diff <- spain_city_diff2 %>%
  dplyr::select(c(,16:27))%>%
  sf::st_drop_geometry(.)%>%
  dplyr::as_tibble()

tidy_city_diff <- city_climate_diff %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(everything(), 
               names_to="Months", 
               values_to="temp_diff")

facet_plot <- tidy_city_diff %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Months = factor(Months, levels = c("Jan","Feb","Mar",
                                            "Apr","May","Jun",
                                            "Jul","Aug","Sep",
                                            "Oct","Nov","Dec")))
# Plot faceted histogram
plot<-ggplot(facet_plot, aes(x=temp_diff, na.rm=TRUE))+
  geom_histogram(color="black", binwidth = .1)+
  labs(title="Ggplot2 faceted difference in climate scenarios of max temp", 
       x="Temperature",
       y="Frequency")+
  facet_grid(Months ~ .)+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

plot

```


## Extra

How about taking each climate scenario and plotting the distribution of max temp values for Spanish cities....

```{r}
